# confluence-buttons

Providing an easy way to add buttons in Confluence without using macros or having to understand the code. Simply add the code of one of the files in an HTML Macro on your site and change the first lines with code.
Every file comes with an normal and a minified version. The minified version is much easier to handle in the code editor in Confluence whereas the normal version is easier to understand.
