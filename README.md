# confluence-buttons

Providing an easy way to add buttons in Confluence without using macros or having to understand the code. Simply add the code of one of the files in an HTML Macro on your site and change the first lines with code.
Every file comes with an normal and a minified version. The minified version is much easier to handle in the code editor in Confluence whereas the normal version is easier to understand.

## How it works
The code usually begins with a data section to make changes easier - even for users with no coding experience. The buttons are then created using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

## Usage
Every piece of code comes in two different forms. The .html-form contains the full readable code for everyone who wants to change something in the code. The .min.html files contain the minified code to be used in production.
